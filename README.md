### About the Experiment 

Reconstructing Averaged Population Response explores how neural population activity can be decoded by averaging the responses of individual neurons. This experiment demonstrates the principles behind population coding and shows how combining responses from multiple neurons can enhance signal interpretation and reduce noise, providing insights into brain information processing.
